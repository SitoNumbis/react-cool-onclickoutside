# React Cool Onclickoutside

This is a React [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#using-a-custom-hook) to execute callback when user clicks outside of the target component(s) area. It's a useful logic for UI interaction design (IxD) like hide a dropdown menu or tooltip etc. Hop you guys ❤️ it!
